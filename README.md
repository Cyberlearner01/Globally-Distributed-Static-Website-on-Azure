# Globally-Distributed-Static-Website-on-Azure
In this project, I will create a globally distributed static website on Azure using Blob Storage and Azure CDN. The site will showcase a crafted resume, ensuring fast and reliable access from multiple regions. This approach enhances visibility for potential employers and provides a seamless user experience.
